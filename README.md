# User-vs-Computer-Dice-Throwing-Game

A simple python coding project I've done to make a small scale computer vs user game.

## How It Works
Aim of the game is to get to 21 without going over or under. You can either roll, stay or hold.

## Viewing your stats
You can also view your stats at the end of every game and see how many games you have won/lost against the computer.
